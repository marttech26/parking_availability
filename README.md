# Parking Space Availability Detection using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting parking space availability using computer vision techniques, specifically employing YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) for object detection. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that offers high accuracy and efficiency. By utilizing this model, we can identify and monitor parking spaces in real-time through video feeds.

## Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand the visual world. It involves developing algorithms and techniques to extract meaningful information from digital images or videos. Computer vision techniques are widely used in various applications such as image recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles.

## YOLOv8
YOLOv8 is a deep learning-based object detection system that belongs to the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models. It operates by dividing the input image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each grid cell. YOLOv8 is known for its real-time performance and high accuracy, making it suitable for applications where fast inference is required, such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and object tracking.
